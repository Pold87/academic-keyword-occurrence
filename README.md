# Historic word occurrence in academic papers

## Summary

This script extracts the historic word occurrence of a search term in
academic papers (from Google Scholar). It allows for spotting trends
in research and analyzing the relevance of a topic over time.

There is a Python 3 branch (master) and a Python 2 branch (python2).

## Usage

`python extract_occurrences.py '<keyword>' <start date> <end date>`

This command lists the number of publications for every year using
this keyword. The script just searches for articles and excludes
patents and citations.

## Update: 
Allows saving csv names as "keyword.csv". Also supports specific inputs
like "Global Outlook Digital Humanities" (with quotation marks)
EG: get_academic_occurence('/"Global Outlook Digital Humanities/"', 2010, 2012)

----

### Alternative: Usage with Docker

You can use [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) to run this script, without the need of having Python or its dependencies installed.

1. Update the `command` with your search term and time range in `docker-compose.yml`
2. run `docker-compose up`

## Example

- Search term: 'bitcoin'
- Desired time span: 2000 to 2015
- Command: `python extract_occurrences.py 'bitcoin' 2000 2015`
- Output: `out.csv`, with the following contents:

| year | results |
|------|---------
| ...  |    ...  |	|
| 2011 |    141  |
| 2012 |    292  |
| 2013 |    889  |
| 2014 |    2370 |
| 2015 |    2580 |
